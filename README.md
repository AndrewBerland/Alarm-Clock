## Running the app

- Install the "Expo Go" app on your phone
- Clone the repo using the terminal command "git clone https://github.com/MaximilianMeiler/Alarm-Clock.git" in the desired location
- In the Alarm-Clock folder created, run "npm i" to install packages
- Then, run "npm run start"
- Scan the resulting QR code with the Expo Go app
  - If this does not work, try creating the code with "npm run tunnel" instead
